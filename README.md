README for whois_webui
==========================

Pre-requisites
-----------------
npm
grunt
bower


Development Server
------------------

The normal maven build process should complete without errors:

    % mvn verify

The server can be started from the command-line:

    % mvn spring-boot:run

Deployment
-------------------
To deploy to any environment (dev/prepdev/rc/prod), create a war using:

    % mvn -Pdeploy package -Dspring.profiles.active=<ENV> 

e.g. to deploy to RC: 

    % mvn -Pdeploy package -Dspring.profiles.active=rc
      
    
this will create a war for the specific environment by calling 
the appropriate grunt task for that environment. The grunt task will
generate the appropriate scripts/app/app.constants.js file.

Also add the "-Dspring.profiles.active=<ENV>" to the JVM args of the application server.

Testing
-------------------
Login to the DEV or PREPDEV environments using the SSO username db-staff@ripe.net / password dbstaffsso.

Architecture
------------

Rules of thumb:

* All rest calls from angular ui go via java-proxy. Java proxy transparently forwards to backends.
* In the new angular CRUD-ui (searching, creating, modifying and deleting whois objects) we stick to the "whoisresources-objects-object"-protocol.
    So when searching for maintainers of sso-user, we return a regular search result. What todo with the star?
    For the service that delivers info for the upper-right-sso-info, we use a dedicated protocol.
* When designing new urls for the java-proxy, stick to the whois conventions
* UI should be as simple as possibly: So fetching or pushing information should be done with a single call. The java proxy can aggregate to achieve this.
* Always try to solve problem in backend. if not possible in java-proxy, as last resort in angular UI. We could promote functions from java-proxy to backend over time, so others can also profit.
* All services a provided by the java-proxy shall be protected by sso. If not logged in, a 403 shall be returned. The angular UI shall redirect to access.ripe.net on a REST 403

Responsibilities of java-proxy: Non functionals only

* Security
* Aggregation
* Same origin
* Api-key to backends
* Caching
* Flexibilty: fix whois problems temporarily
