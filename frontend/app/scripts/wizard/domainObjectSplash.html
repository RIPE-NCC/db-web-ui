            <p>Make sure you set up at least two name servers that are authoritative for the zone.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that the servers are at least in different subnets, but preferably in different networks that are geographically distributed.</li>
                <li>The resolvable names of these name servers should be in the NS resource records of the zone.</li>
                <li>The SOA resource record (RR) should have the same content, both serial number and other data, on all the nameservers.</li>
                <li>The SOA should contain a valid 'RNAME' (the contact address).</li>
                <li>The timing parameters should be reasonable.</li>
            </ul>
